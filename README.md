# Security Playground for Developers
The main purpose of the lab environment is to teach developers which code blocks are vulnerable to common vulnerabilities and how to protect them.

It is considered as the security version of HackerRank. It includes SQL Injection challenge for PHP. However, other web vulnerabilities can be easily added to this setup.

Easter egg: Besides, there is another web vulnerability in the lab environment.
